# IcedCubes-CreatedShaders
A collection of all my Created Shaders.

The shaders included are not limited to one game;
but will not look good in most cases.

the shaders will be separated into different gamesto avoid confusion,
and for the sake of organizasion.

- Adds more of a 'red' tint on the screen instead of blue
- Minimal Performance impact
- 'Blooms' light, makes it slightly brighter
- Lessens the Bluish tint on your screen (doesn't affect the LifeBlood much)
